# Privacy Policy for Readeck AI Summaries

_Last updated: October 2025_

Readeck AI Summaries does not collect, store, or transmit any personal user data.

## Information Handling

- The extension operates entirely within your browser.
- When you click the “AI Summary” button, the text of the current Readeck article is sent directly to the OpenAI API for summarization.
- The OpenAI API key you provide is stored locally in your browser using Chrome’s secure `storage.local` system and is never transmitted to any server other than OpenAI’s API endpoint.
- No information is shared with the developer or any third party.
- The extension does not track browsing history, page activity, or usage analytics.

## Permissions
Readeck AI Summaries requests the following permissions only to function properly:
- **storage** — to locally store your API key and settings.
- **scripting** — to inject the summary button and display the summary inline.
- **activeTab / host access** — to read the current article text on Readeck pages.

## Data Sharing
- No data is sold, shared, or transferred to any third party.
- The only network request made is the direct call to the OpenAI API you configure.

## Contact
